# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned how to understand the sturcture of code through learning Java and was able to understand the API enough to know how to write the examples.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> "Raising the level of absraction" means that the comments should generally explain the method and not get too into specifics of how it works. Comments are more about what it does rather than how it does it. My advice to 142 students is to keep comments short and sweet and to make them to the point, much like my answers to this readme.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 6 hours


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No help from people, because I'm a big who wears big boy pants. However I did refer to MSDN for help with some JS methods.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> None to my knowledge, this was a good assignemnt.
